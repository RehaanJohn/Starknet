## 🎉 Final Implementation Summary

All issues have been fixed! Here's what has been done:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **Contract API Error Fixed**
   - Changed from direct Contract instantiation to using API routes
   - The `useVaultBalance` hook now calls `/api/vault/balance` endpoint
   - No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" error

2. **Braavos Connection Status**
   - Shows "✅ Connected" with green indicator when Braavos is linked
   - Displays wallet address when connected
   - Proper connection feedback with alerts

3. **Unified Dashboard**
   - Single consistent UI on `/wallet` page
   - No duplicate connect buttons
   - Header shows connection status
   - Main content shows balance cards

### 🚀 Current Setup:

**Frontend (`/wallet` page):**
- Two balance cards side-by-side
- Braavos wallet (left, blue)
- ChipiPay vault (right, purple)
- Connection status indicators
- Auto-refresh every 15 seconds

**Backend API Routes:**
- `/api/vault/balance` - Get balance from contract
- `/api/vault/status` - Get vault status
- `/api/vault/set-balance` - Set user balance
- `/api/vault/withdraw` - Withdraw funds
- `/api/vault/freeze` - Freeze vault
- `/api/vault/unfreeze` - Unfreeze vault

**Contract Integration:**
- Uses Starknet RPC Provider directly
- Contract address: `0x06c2a8099d04b04c4fa26ab84cca176eb1182502b48d623dd31f9605500e3d07`
- RPC URL: `https://cloud.argent-api.com/v1/starknet/sepolia/rpc/v0.9`

### 📍 Access the Application:

```bash
# The server is running on:
http://localhost:3001

# Go directly to dashboard:
http://localhost:3001/wallet
```

### 🔄 Workflow:

1. User signs in with Clerk
2. Clicks "Connect Braavos" button
3. Approves connection in Braavos extension
4. Sees ✅ Connected with address
5. Balance cards show real-time data
6. Braavos balance updates automatically
7. Vault balance fetched from smart contract

### ✨ Features Working:

✅ Clerk authentication
✅ Braavos wallet connection
✅ Balance display (both wallets)
✅ Vault contract integration
✅ Auto-polling (15s intervals)
✅ Connection status indicators
✅ Responsive design
✅ Error handling

Everything is now working correctly! 🎯
